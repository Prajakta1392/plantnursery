<h1 align="center"><u><b>About Nurserylive</b></u></font></h1></p>
<ul type="circle"></ul>
<li>Nurserylive germinated in 2014 from a promise to make ‘green and healthy’ a click away for all Indians</li>
<br />

<li>Having plants in our homes or in our offices doesn’t just look good, it also boosts our mood, makes us more productive, and cleans the air around us by absorbing toxins</li>
<br />

<li>Most of us being urban dwellers spending their days in apartments with limited access to parks and ecological reserves, have no way of feeling close to nature and experiencing the benefits of being around plants.</li>
<br />

<li>We believe that Green is Good and are here to enable Indians to access plants in the easiest way possible – online! We are here to shape the future of gardening!</li>
<br />
